**Tired of your personal apps wandering the digital wilderness?**  
**Lost in the `~/Downloads` abyss?**  
**Scattered across random cloud folders like lost socks?**

Say hello to **AppMovin** — the cozy, localized, and cloud-connected sanctuary your apps have been dreaming of. It's like a 5-star hotel for your `.dmg`, `.pkg`, and `.app` files.

## 🌟 Why AppMovin?

*   **🏠 A Home for Every App**: Finally, a centralized dashboard for all those tools you built or downloaded.
*   **☁️ Cloud Sync Magic**: Connect **Google Drive** (and soon OneDrive/Baidu) to keep your apps safe in the sky.
*   **📂 Drag, Drop, Done**: Uploading is as easy as tossing a crumpled paper ball into a trash can (but way more satisfying).
*   **⚡️ Lightning Fast**: Built with **Electron** and **Next.js**, so it's snappy, modern, and looks good doing it.
*   **🔒 Your Data, Your Rules**: Local storage? Cloud storage? You decide where your digital babies live.
